Titanpack supports CJS and ESM imports out of the box, and offers partial support for AMD.

Titanpack bundles your application, so imports won't be resolved to native browser ESM. You can learn why in our [bundling vs Native ESM](/pack/docs/why-titanpack#bundling-vs-native-esm) section.

## CommonJS

Titanpack supports the `require` syntax out-of-the-box:

```ts title="my-file.ts"
const { add } = require('./math');

add(1, 2);
```

## ESM

Importing via the `import` syntax is also supported out-of-the-box. This includes static assets, and `import type`:

```ts title="my-file.ts"
import img from './img.png';

import type { User } from '../server/types';

import { z } from 'zod';
```

## Dynamic Imports

Titanpack supports dynamic imports via `import()`:

```ts title="my-file.ts"
const getFeatureFlags = () => {
  return import('/featureFlags').then((mod) => {
    return mod.featureFlags;
  });
};
```
