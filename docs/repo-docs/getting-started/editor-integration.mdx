To get the best experience with `titan`, Titanrepo provides a few utilities for integrating with your editor.

## JSON Schema for `titan.json`

Titanrepo uses [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to give you auto-complete in your
`titan.json` file. By including the `$schema` key in your `titan.json`, your editor is able to
provide full documentation and linting in case you have invalid shapes or missing keys.

```json title="./titan.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://titan.khulnasoft.com/schema.json"
}
```

### Older versions

If you are using Titanrepo v1, use `schema.v1.json`.

```json title="./titan.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://titan.khulnasoft.com/schema.v1.json"
}
```

Handling environment variables is an important part of building applications in a Titanrepo.

[The `eslint-config-titan` package](/repo/docs/reference/eslint-config-titan) extends your ESLint setup to help you make sure you've taken care of all of your environment variables.

## Titanrepo LSP

Enable even more auto-complete and linting than provided by JSON Schema, with in-editor hinting for invalid globs, references to non-existent tasks or packages, and
extra repository visibility tools.

Visit the [VSCode Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vercel.titan-vsc) to install.
