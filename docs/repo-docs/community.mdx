## Acknowledgements

Titanrepo was originally created by [Jared Palmer](https://x.com/jaredpalmer) as a closed-source enterprise software offering. In late 2021, [Vercel acquired Titanrepo](https://khulnasoft.com/blog/vercel-acquires-titanrepo) and open sourced the codebase.

Today, Titanrepo has dedicated full-time team working on it as well as a growing list of [open source contributors](https://github.com/khulnasoft/titanrepo/graphs/contributors).
