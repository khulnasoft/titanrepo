title: Unnecessary package task syntax error
description: Learn more about errors with unnecessary package task syntax in Titanrepo.

## Why this error occurred

Titanrepo supports adding additional `titan.json` files in a package directory
to override the `titan.json` file declared at the repository root, a feature called [Workspace Configurations](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/structuring-a-repository#specifying-packages-in-a-monorepo).
In those additional `titan.json` files, you can only configure tasks for that specific
package. Therefore, only the task name should be included in the task,
not the package and task name (`package#task`).

`titan.json` file in `apps/web` directory:

```json title="./titan.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "web#build": {
      "dependsOn": ["lint"]
    }
  }
}
```

Since this `titan.json` file is inside a package directory, the `web` prefix is unnecessary.

## Solution

Remove the package prefix from the task name:

```json title="./titan.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["lint"]
    }
  }
}
```
