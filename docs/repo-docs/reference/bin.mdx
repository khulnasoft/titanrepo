description: API reference for the `titan bin` command
---

Get the path to the `titan` binary.

When using [**global `titan`**](/repo/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), this will be the path to the global `titan` binary. You're likely to see a path to the global directory of the package manager you used to install `titan`.

When using [**local `titan`**](/repo/docs/getting-started/installation#repository-installation), this will be the path to the local `titan` binary. When `titan` is installed in your repository, it is likely to be a path to `node_modules`.
