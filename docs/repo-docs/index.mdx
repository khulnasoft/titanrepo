## What is Titanrepo?

Titanrepo is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It is designed for scaling monorepos and also makes workflows in [single-package workspaces](/repo/docs/guides/single-package-workspaces) faster, too.

From individual developers to the largest enterprise engineering organizations in the world, Titanrepo is saving years of engineering time and millions of dollars in compute costs through a lightweight approach to optimizing the tasks you need to run in your repository.

## The monorepo problem

Monorepos have many advantages - but **they struggle to scale**. Each workspace has its own test suite, its own linting, and its own build process. A single monorepo might have **thousands of tasks to execute**.

These slowdowns can dramatically affect the way your teams build software, especially at scale. Feedback loops need to be fast so developers can deliver high-quality code quickly.

## The monorepo solution

**Titanrepo solves your monorepo's scaling problem**. [Remote Cache](/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) stores the result of all your tasks, meaning that **your CI never needs to do the same work twice**.

Additionally, task scheduling can be difficult in a monorepo. You may need to build, _then_ test, _then_ lint...

Titanrepo **schedules your tasks for maximum speed**, parallelizing work across all available cores.

Titanrepo can be **adopted incrementally** and you can **add it to any repository in just a few minutes**. It uses the `package.json` scripts you've already written, the dependencies you've already declared, and a single `titan.json` file. You can **use it with any package manager**, like `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm` since Titanrepo leans on the conventions of the npm ecosystem.

## How to use these docs

We will do our best to keep jargon to a minimum - but there are some need-to-know words that will be important to understand as you read through the docs. We've created [a glossary page](https://khulnasoft.com/docs/vercel-platform/glossary) to help you out in case you're learning about these terms.
