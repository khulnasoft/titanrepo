With Titanrepo 1.3 we are bringing improved caching and flexibility which includes:

- [**Restricted hash inputs:**](#pipeline-inputs) Specify the files in a package folder that impact caching with `inputs`.
- [**Root script running and caching:**](#run-and-cache-scripts-from-the-root-of-your-monorepo) Run and cache `package.json` scripts from the root of the monorepo.
- [**New CI/CD Recipes:**](#new-cicd-recipes) We added recipes for using Titanrepo with popular CI providers.

Update today by running `npm install titan@latest`.

## Pipeline `inputs`

In addition to [environment variables, dependencies, and pipeline configurations,](/docs/core-concepts/caching#hashing) `titan` will consider all non-gitignored files in package folder when calculating each `package.json` script's hash fingerprint (the key that `titan` uses to index its cache and to determine if a script needs to be re-executed). **With Titanrepo 1.3+, you can now specify globs of `inputs` in your `titan.json` `pipeline` to control which files are relevant for a particular script for caching.** This means that you can now express the following in `titan.json`

- Ignore changes to all markdown files in a package or app's folder.
- Don't bother rebuilding an app if only its test files have changed.
- Only re-run tests if either source files or test files have been changed in a package or folder.
- and more.

Let's walk through a concrete example: imagine we have a monorepo with a Next.js application for a documentation website in `./apps/docs-site`, some packages, and some markdown files in the root of the monorepo in a `./docs` folder.

```sh filename="Example monorepo"
.
├── docs/
│   ├── api-reference.md
│   ├── getting-started.md
│   └── intro.md
├── apps/
│   ├── docs-site/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   │   └── [slug].js
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── web-site/
│       ├── pages/
│       ├── README.md
│       └── package.json
├── packages/
│   ├── configs/
│   └── ui/
├── package.json
└── titan.json
```

Let's assume that the Next.js `docs-site` renders the markdown files from the `./docs` folder. We can now set up the `build` script in the app's `package.json` to use `inputs` in `titan.json` to better specify exactly which files are relevant (and which should impact caching) as follows:

```jsonc filename="./titan.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://titan.khulnasoft.com/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    // ... omitted for brevity
	 "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "dist/**"],
   },
   "docs#build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**"],
      // Define set of relevant globs which impact caching of docs site
      // builds
      "inputs": [
        "../../docs/**/*.md",
        "pages/**",
        "components/**",
        "package.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Like `outputs`, `inputs` are defined relative to the related `package.json` , but they can be outside of a given folder (`e.g. ../../docs/**`).

## Run and cache scripts from the root of your monorepo

As of 1.3, **`titan` can now run and cache scripts from the `package.json` file at the root of the monorepo**, which will help significantly when migrating to Titanrepo.

To set this up, specify a root script in your `pipeline` configuration in your `titan.json` using the form `"//#<script>": {...}`. The `//` tells `titan` that the script is relative to the root of the monorepo and not each workspace package.

There are 2 important things to note about root scripts and execution scope:

- If you already have `"build": {...}` in your `pipeline`, but want to include the `build` script defined in the monorepo's root `package.json` file when running `titan run build`, you may opt the root into the execution's scope by also including `"//#build": {...}` in your configuration as well.
- Conversely, you _do not_ need to define a generic `"my-script": {...}` entry if all you need is `"//#my-script": {...}`.

A sample pipeline that defines the root script `check-examples` and opts the root into `test` might look like:

```json filename="./package.json"
{
  "name": "my-titanrepo",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo 'test!'",
    "check-examples": "./check-examples.sh"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "titan": "latest"
  }
}
```

```jsonc filename="./titan.json" highlight="20"
{
  "$schema": "https://titan.khulnasoft.com/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [],
    },
    // This will cause the "test" script from all workspace package.json's
    // AND the root package.json to be included when "titan run test" is run
    "//#test": {
      "dependsOn": [],
      "outputs": []
    },
    // This will cause the "check-examples" script in the root package.json
    // to be run when "titan run check-examples" is run. Since a general
    // "check-examples" script is not defined in the pipeline, only the root
    // package.json's "check-examples" script will be included
    // when "titan run check-examples" is run
    "//#check-examples": {
      "dependsOn": [],
      "outputs": [],
      "inputs": [
        "examples/**/*.ts",
        "examples/**/*.tsx",
        "examples/**/*.json",
        "examples/**/*.js",
        "examples/**/*.yaml",
        "cli/**/*.ts",
        "./scripts/run-example.sh"
       ]
    },
  }
}
```

Note: We suggest specifying `inputs` whenever declaring a root task in your `pipeline` to improve caching.

## New CI/CD Recipes

We added recipes for using Titanrepo and Remote Caching with:

- [CircleCI](/docs/ci/circleci)
- [GitHub Actions](/docs/ci/github-actions)
- [Gitlab CI](/docs/ci/gitlabci)
- [Travis CI](/docs/ci/travisci)

If there are other recipes you would like to see here please let us know by opening up a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/khulnasoft/titanrepo/discussions/categories/ideas).

## Other Bug Fixes and Improvements
