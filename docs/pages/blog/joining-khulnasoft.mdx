Titanrepo has been acquired by Khulnasoft and the Titanrepo CLI is now open-source! Also, Titanrepo now provides zero-config remote caching throughÂ [Khulnasoft](https://khulnasoft.com/?utm_source=titan.khulnasoft.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=docs-link)!

[beta.titan.khulnasoft.com](http://beta.titan.khulnasoft.com/) and its remote caching service will be shut down on January 15th, 2022 and older versions of the `titan` CLI will not be installable. Learn more about how to upgrade your CLI and migrate to Khulnasoft [here](https://titan.khulnasoft.com/docs/upgrading-to-v1).

This is a milestone moment for the project and for all of you who have supported and adopted Titanrepo. With Khulnasoft's infrastructure and team backing, I'll expand on the capabilities of Titanrepo and build out a team focused on improving their world-class build system. I can't wait to bring you along for this [next chapter](https://khulnasoft.com/blog/khulnasoft-acquires-titanrepo).

Join me this [Friday, December 10 at 4:00 p.m. ET | 9:00 p.m GMT for a livestream Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX5yoApjI3M) with Khulnasoft's Head of Developer Relations, Lee Robinson. We'll go over what's in store for Titanrepo and Khulnasoft as we work toward improving the developer experience together.

This is just the beginning. We're about to embark on a world of even faster builds, even more flexibility, and even better workflows. Thanks for joining us on this amazing journey.
