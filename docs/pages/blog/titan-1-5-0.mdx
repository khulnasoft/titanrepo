Titanrepo 1.5 is a **huge leap forward for our documentation and DX**, as well as bringing big improvements to `titan prune`:

- [**The Monorepo Handbook**](#the-monorepo-handbook): We've built the missing manual for your monorepo - a guide on workspaces, code sharing, integrating common tools and much more.
- [**Drop the `run`**](#drop-the-run): `titan run <task>` can now be shortened to `titan <task>`
- [**`titan prune` now supports pnpm and yarn 2+**](#prune-now-supported-on-pnpm-and-yarn-2): Pruning your monorepo is now supported in `pnpm` and `yarn@berry`.
- [**Improved environment variables in `titan.json`**](#environment-variables-in-titanjson): Environment variables are now first-class citizens in your Titanrepo pipeline configuration.
- [**Changes to `package.json` hashing**](#changes-to-packagejson-hashing): We've improved how we hash `package.json` when running tasks.

Update today by running `npm install titan@latest`.

## The Monorepo Handbook

Setting up a monorepo for the first time often means navigating a lot of new concepts. You'll need to understand workspaces, package installation, sharing code and dependency management - and a lot more.

This often meant that folks who wanted to set up a monorepo from scratch had to piece information together from different documentation sites. First `pnpm`, then `tsup`, then back to `changesets`, then back to Titanrepo for dessert.

We want to fill this gap with [the Monorepo Handbook](/docs/handbook). We've built guides on how to integrate all the tools you'll need to make ship happen with your monorepo, including guides on:

- [Installing Packages](/docs/handbook/package-installation)
- [Linting](/docs/handbook/linting)
- [Development Tasks](/docs/handbook/dev)
- [Building Apps](/docs/handbook/building-your-app)
- [Publishing Packages](/docs/handbook/publishing-packages)

## Drop the `run`

<iframe className="max-w-xl h-72 sm:h-96 w-full mt-6" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PEgk2v6KntY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

You can now run tasks with the Titanrepo CLI using `titan <task>`.

```diff
- titan run build
+ titan build


- titan run lint build test
+ titan lint build test
```

If your task name conflicts with a built-in `titan` subcommand, we'll run our subcommand instead. That means you shouldn't name your tasks things like `prune`, `run`, or `login` - since those are built-in subcommands.

`titan run <task>` will continue to work, and there are no plans to deprecate it.

## Prune now supported on pnpm and yarn 2+

We're delighted to announce that [`titan prune`](/docs/reference/command-line-reference#titan-prune---scopetarget) now supports in pnpm, yarn, and yarn 2+.

You can use `titan prune` to create a pruned subset of your monorepo with a dedicated lockfile--with the correct dependencies needed for a given target application and its dependencies. This is especially useful for using efficiently Titanrepo within a Docker image.

As part of the new handbook, we've also added a section on using `titan prune` to [build docker images](/docs/handbook/deploying-with-docker).

Check out our previous [blog on prune](/blog/titan-0-4-0#experimental-pruned-workspaces) to learn more.

## Environment variables in `titan.json`

We've introduced two new keys to `titan.json` - `env` and `globalEnv`. These allow environment variables to be configured _separately_ from tasks:

```diff filename="titan.json"
{
  "globalDependencies": [
-   "$DATABASE_URL"
  ],
+ "globalEnv": [
+   "DATABASE_URL"
+ ],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": [
-       "$BUILD_ENV"
      ],
+     "env": [
+       "BUILD_ENV"
+     ]
    }
  }
}
```

`globalEnv` and `env` allow you to specify a list of environment variables _without_ `$` prefixes. This makes the configuration file significantly easier to read. Read more [in our updated docs](/docs/core-concepts/caching#altering-caching-based-on-environment-variables).

To help migrate from the previous syntax, we've prepared a codemod. You can run `npx @titan/codemod migrate-env-var-dependencies`.

This work builds on the [automatic env variable detection](/blog/titan-1-4-0) we added in 1.4.0.

## Changes to `package.json` hashing

The `package.json` file in each workspace is now _always_ considered an input for tasks in that workspace. This means that if you change the _definition_ for a task in `package.json`, we want to invalidate any caches from the previous definition.

This also counts for the `package.json` in the root. Changes to the root `package.json` will invalidate tasks in the root workspace.

This helps make Titanrepo's cache a bit smarter, and less likely to trip up when task definitions change.

## Community

Since releasing [Titanrepo v1.4 in August](/blog/titan-1-4-0), we've seen incredible adoption and community growth:

- [9.5k+ GitHub Stars](https://github.com/khulnasoft/titanrepo)
- [440k weekly NPM downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/titan)
- 15 years of compute time saved through [Remote Caching on Khulnasoft](https://khulnasoft.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/remote-caching), saving over a 1 year per week, up 2x since July

Titanrepo is the result of the combined work of all of our contributors including our core team.
