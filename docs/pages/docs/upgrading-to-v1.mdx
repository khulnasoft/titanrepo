# Upgrading to Titanrepo v1.x

Titanrepo has been acquired by Khulnasoft! With this announcement, **Khulnasoft is open sourcing the `titan` CLI and offering Remote Caching for free on all accounts during the transition period.**

Existing Titanrepo customers should upgrade their `titan` CLI to v1.x as soon as possible and migrate to Khulnasoft (instructions below). Earlier versions of `titan` CLI prior to 1.x will no longer be maintained going forward. New account creation on beta.titan.khulnasoft.com has been disabled. The beta.titan.khulnasoft.com dashboard and remote caching service will be shutdown on January 15th, 2022 and older versions will not be installable.

**All existing Remote Cache artifacts will also be deleted at this time**.

Below is a step-by-step migration guide for existing Titanrepo users. If you get stuck, please reach out in the community [Discord](https://titan.khulnasoft.com/discord) or file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/khulnasoft/titanrepo). Thank you again for your continued support as we begin this awesome new chapter of Titanrepo together.

## 1. Cleaning up

For good hygiene, ensure you logout of `titan` to remove old credentials:

```sh
yarn titan logout
```

If it exists, also delete the `.titan` directory from the root of your monorepo:

```sh
rm -rf .titan
```

## 2. Install the latest release of `titan`

Install the latest version version of `titan`:

```sh
yarn add titan --save-dev --ignore-workspace-root-check
```

## 3. Setup Remote Caching

As mentioned, Titanrepo now provides zero-config Remote Caching through [Khulnasoft](https://khulnasoft.com?utm_source=titan.khulnasoft.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=docs-link). Remote Caching is free for all Khulnasoft plans during this transition period. Each Khulnasoft account has a shared Remote Cache. This cache is shared across all environments (Development, Preview, and Production).

**Important**: titan.khulnasoft.com allowed multiple caches (i.e. projects) per team (denoted through `--project` flag). With v1.x caching on Khulnasoft, each Khulnasoft account (user or team) has a single shared Remote Cache. If you were actively using multiple titan.khulnasoft.com projects for your team, please let us know in [Discord](https://titan.khulnasoft.com/discord).

Please note that we are not migrating cache artifacts to Khulnasoft. We apologize for the slower builds during your migration as you rehydrate your remote cache on Khulnasoft or custom cache infra.

## 4. Local Development

If you were using Remote Caching for local development, upgrading will take a minute or two. To get started, login to the Khulnasoft CLI:

```sh
npx titan login
```

Now we can set up Remote Caching through Khulnasoft by running:

```sh
npx titan link
```

Follow the prompts and select the Khulnasoft account (user or team) to wish to connect to.

### On Khulnasoft

- If you already used Titanrepo and Khulnasoft together, remove `TITAN_TOKEN`, `TITAN_TEAM`, and `TITAN_PROJECT` environment variables from all projects. These are now automatically set on your behalf by Khulnasoft.

- Remove the usage of `--team`, `--token`, and `--project` CLI flags in your Khulnasoft project settings and/or `package.json` scripts.

### On other CI/CD

- Replace your titan.khulnasoft.com personal access token with a new [Khulnasoft personal access token](https://khulnasoft.com/account/tokens) and update `TITAN_TOKEN` environment variable or equivalent usage of the `--token` CLI flag.
- Remove the `TITAN_PROJECT` environment variable and remove all usage of the `--project` CLI flag. This has been deprecated.
- Update the value of the `TITAN_TEAM` environment variable and `--team` CLI flag to be your Khulnasoft account slug (i.e. `https://khulnasoft.com/<slug>`).
