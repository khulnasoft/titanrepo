# `titan-ignore`

To get started, use the following command as your [Ignored Build Step](https://khulnasoft.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#ignored-build-step):

```sh
$ npx titan-ignore
```

This uses `titan` to automatically determine if the current app has new changes that need to be deployed.
